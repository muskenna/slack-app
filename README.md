# Slack App

Welcome to the `slack-app` repository! This project houses a Slack App developed
in TypeScript, designed to provide automatic responses in Slack channels across
your workspace. Once integrated, this app is capable of engaging with messages
in any channel where it's added, enhancing communication and efficiency within
your team's Slack environment.


## Slack App Manifest

The `slack.app.manifest.yaml`` file provides the schema for the app's
configuration in Slack. It details the bot's operational scope and the events it
can access, such as the necessary OAuth scopes and the bot events it listens to.
Importantly, this file is used for reference only and cannot be directly applied
in operational settings. It serves as a guide to understand the app's
capabilities and permissions within the Slack workspace.
